Module 14 Challenge

For this challenge, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

My Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard consists of:

  - A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

  - A bubble chart that displays each sample.

  - Sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information including each key-value pair from the metadata JSON
    object.
